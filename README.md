# gradientdescent
Simple gradient descent/ascent examples with tensorflow

1. **Minimize a function** 
* [Function of one variable](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/1a_tf_GD_1d.py): Find the argument that minimizes a function of one variable. 


2. **Maximize an expected value**
* [Discrete probability, exact expectation](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/2a_tf_GD_prob.py): Find the discrete probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given function.

* [Discrete probability, approximate expectation via sampling](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/2b_tf_GD_sample.py): Sampling based implementation to find the discrete probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given function. 

* [Continuous probability density, approximate expectation via sampling](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/2c_tf_GD_cont.py): Sampling based implementation to find the parameters of a probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given utility function
