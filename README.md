# gradientdescent
Simple gradient descent/ascent examples with tensorflow

1. **Minimize a function**: 
* [function of one variable](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/1_tf_GD.py): Find the argument of a function where the minimal value is achieved. 

2. **Maximize an expected value**:
* [discrete probability, exact expectation](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/2_tf_GD_prob.py): Find the discrete probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given function.

* [discrete probability, approximate expectation via sampling](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/3_tf_GD_sample.py): Sampling based implementation to find the discrete probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given function. 

* [continuous probability density, approximate expectation via sampling](https://github.com/sgttwld/gradientdescent/blob/master/4_tf_GD_cont.py): Sampling based implementation to find the parameters of a probability distribution that maximizes the expected value of a given utility function
